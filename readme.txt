**What is TokenICO?**

TokenICO, which is called Cryptocurrency (Token), Launchpad (Presale), ICO & IDO, Airdrop, is a plugin that offers you everything you need for your cryptocurrency projects. With TokenICO, you can create presales for your tokens on EVM networks (ERC20, BEP20), Solana SPL Tokens or other supported networks. To understand TokenICO in more detail, here are some of the features it has and will have.

**How is TokenICO free?**

So basically, yes, you can download TokenICO for free and install it on your WordPress site. However, while there will be free features, the features that are currently available are charged on a commission-based and per-transaction basis. For example, it costs 0.1 Native Coin to create a presale for EVM networks. This can be 0.1 ETH or 0.1 BNB, depending on the network. For the Solana network, the pre-sale creation fee is 0.5 SOL. However, the commission rate per sale on all networks is 3%. Since the person who will use this plugin will use it to make money, we don't think you will complain about these fees. Because we need funding to continue developing this plugin. If you complain about these fees, you can use expensive alternatives like PinkSale.

**Supported Networks:**

* All EVM based networks (Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Polygon)
* Solana
* Tron

**Feature list**

* Presale: Available
* Airdrop: Coming soon
* Token creator: Coming soon

**TokenICO Fee Information:**

* EVM:
    * Create presale: 0.1 native coin
    * Sale process: %3 commission per sale
* Solana:
    * Create presale: 0.5 SOL
    * Sale process: 3% commission per sale
* Tron:
    * Create presale: 500 TRX
    * Sale process: 3% commission per sale

**PinkSale Fee Information for Compare:**

* EVM:
    * Create presale: 0.2 ETH, 1 BNB (we don't know for other chains)
    * Sale process: 5% commission per sale
* Solana:
    * Create presale: 4 SOL
    * Sale process: %5 commission per sale
* Tron: Not exists (we don't know another service for Tron)

In this case, any kind of TokenICO seems more profitable and logical, right?

**BUY TokenICO Premium**

***If you want to use TokenICO without any commission, you can buy the premium version.***

**TokenICO Contract Deployed Networks**

Since a significant amount of money has to be paid during the contract deployment, we have done contract deployments in some highly used networks. However, if you want to pre-sell on a network other than the ones below, this is not a problem. Because the contract will be automatically deployed and saved during pre-sale publishing. So after deploying once, you can publish presale again on the same network.

Contract deployed on these networks:

* Ethereum (ERC20) - (Mainnet & Testnet)
* Binance (BNB) Smart Chain (BEP20) - (Mainnet & Testnet)
* Avalanche - (Mainnet & Testnet)
* Polygon - (Mainnet & Testnet)
* Solana - (Mainnet & Testnet)

**Highlights:**

* Set presale start and end dates
* Set minimum and maximum purchase limits
* Frontend presale area with progress bar and timed
* Easily add a presale area wherever you want with a shortcode
* Supports all EVM based networks for example (Ethereum (ERC20), Binance (BNB) Smart Chain (BEP20), Avalanche, Polygon)
* Instant delivery at the time of purchase and token request feature when presale ends (So users may or may not have the token before the presale ends)
* Cheapest Solana SPL Token Presale, Launchpad, ICO & IDO, Airdrop, Token Program, Token Program 2022, Taxable SPL Token

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

TokenICO works by mapping the data on your WordPress site to the data in the contract during the pre-sale. If you are using a cache mechanism on the page where the presale is located, the plugin may malfunction due to data synchronization.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=Can I get the source code of presale? Can I verify?=
The answer to this will of course be no. Because if you already have the pre-sale source code, you can pre-sale without paying any commission. For this reason, we do not provide or verified presale source code.

If you have trust issues, you have two options:
* You will not use the plugin
* You will get custom development service from us

If you get custom development service from us, there will be no commission on pre-sale and of course it will be verified on explorer.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `/tokenico-cryptocurrency-token-launchpad-presale-ico-ido-airdrop` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate TokenICO - Cryptocurrency (Token), Launchpad (Presale), ICO & IDO, Airdrop through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Enjoy.
